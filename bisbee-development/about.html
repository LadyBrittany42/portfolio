  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Brittany S Bisbee-Green, 38, was raised in a household of creative, analytical thinkers. Being an analytical thinker herself, she focuses on details. Brittany is interested in patterns, contrast, and juxtaposition within design and life in general.</p> 

<p>“I am honest, hardworking, detail focused, and time-oriented. I work well under pressure, delegate tasks successfully when necessary, and I am hungry for knowledge and experience. I am also a leader in my spiritual community, where I have volunteered for the role of being in service to others on their spiritual journey. I have a thirst for learning and am looking for a position that is both challenging and rewarding.”</p> 

<p>Brittany graduated from The University of Arkansas at Little Rock in 2013 with a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts. Her areas of emphasis were Photography, Art History, and Psychology. She then returned in 2020 for a Post-Baccalaureate degree in Web Design and Development.</p>

<p>“While in school, I am gaining the skills to build and manage websites, create beautiful and useful images and content, and honing adaptability skills.”</p>

<p>Some of Brittany’s past experience comes from her days as an employee at a movie theatre. While she started in the concession stand and box office, she quickly learned the job of a booth employee.</p>

<p>“I loved working in the booth upstairs. It was always enjoyable to spend my time splicing together movies with the whir of projectors behind me. I not only learned the ins and outs of the film, but also how to clean and run the projectors. They became my children in a way. It was my responsibility to take care of them and make sure everything ran smoothly.”</p>

<p>This wouldn’t be Brittany’s only experience with film. While studying Photography at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, she was fortunate enough to enroll in a large format photography class.</p>

<p>“Learning how to navigate Large Format Photography was both challenging and gratifying. Since it is one of the oldest forms of photography, every aspect is analog and meticulous. It connects you to the image in a way that is lost in the 21st century.</p> 

<p>Brittany fell so in love with the antiquated style, she jumped at the chance to participate in a workshop hosted by The Arkansas Arts Center.</p>

<p>“I had the incredible opportunity to create my own Ambrotype (an image on glass). The whole process was amazing.”</p>

<p>Brittany’s return to college student status was an unlikely turn of events. After all, it has been almost a decade since she has delved into a text book.</p> 

<p>“I didn’t think I would return to school. The more time passed, however, the more apparent it became to me that I needed (and wanted) more. I want to create; to take pieces and transform them into something great. Web Design is a way to let me do that. So, I’m pursuing Web Design as a dream and a career.”</p>
